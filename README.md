# Mapbox accessibility demo.

This is an experiment to test the [Mapbox accessibility plugin](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-accessibility). It currently uses a [fork](https://github.com/team-blaze/mapbox-gl-accessibility) of the plugin.

## Usage:

First set the mapbox token in [`index.js`](./index.js)

Then run:

```bash
make serve
```
